This is a practice project where I:
- put to use 
- enhance my **Python skills**
- and my **game development skills**,  
to develop a simple Space Shooter game.   

I followed a tutorial for most of the part, while I also consulted the pygame docs. However the tutorial also offered many exercises to apply each fresh knowledge acquired. 

Making games in pygame demands good python skills among which the following are fundamental: 
- Object Oriented Programming principles: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Inheritance
- Code structure
- Dictionaries and lists
- and of course all the rest: functions and other libraries

These skills are easily transferable from pygame to data science because this is all Python. 

**WHAT DID I LEARN**:
- that there is a **difference** between the **code in development** and the code for **compiling the distributable** exe game (Inno compiler and pyinstaller)
- that **modules import and folders paths** are to be **thought out carefully** too for a better **compiling**

**THE GAME**:
- a **simple shooter** where you are trying to **not collide** into a meteor and **destroy** as many as you can. 
- the player can **freely move** in all directions using the keyboard arrows
- the number of **meteors increase** with time
- some **speed up capsules** appear randomly from destroyed meteors and if caught they add speed to the player (they can add up)  

The **last two features I implemented them**, they were not covered in the tutorial.  
I also added these: 
- **splash screen with instructions** printed out before the game & music start
- a **dynamic meteors count** (for each meteor destroyed)
- a **new sound** when a speed up capsule is caught
- a **new music** for the game (made in Suno)

**INSTALL THE GAME!**  
If you're on **Windows**, you can download the game from the **[release folder](https://github.com/jendives2000/Data_ML_Practice_2025/tree/0d973e92c96747aa34f3db777de59ecc09158744/0_Python/practice/pygame-ce_python/release)** and install it and play it! It's under 70MO. 

The music was made with gen AI suno. All assets were given by the YouTuber of the video in under the title at the start of this document.
