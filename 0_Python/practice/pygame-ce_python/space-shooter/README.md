This is a practice project where I put to use and enhance my Python skills to develop a simple Space Shooter game.  
I followed a tutorial for most of the part, while I also consulted the pygame docs. However the tutorial also offered many exercises to apply each fresh knowledge acquired. 

Making games in pygame demands good python skills among which the following are fundamental: 
- Object Oriented Programming principles: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Inheritance
- Code structure
- Dictionaries and lists
- and of course all the rest: functions and other libraries

These skills are easily transferable from pygame to data science because this is all Python.
