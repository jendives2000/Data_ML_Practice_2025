- **WHY ARCADE?**  
  Using the **Arcade** library over **Pygame-ce** offers clear advantages for learners who want to deepen their understanding of Python and write cleaner, more maintainable code. 
  
  Arcade is fully object-oriented, making it ideal for practicing real-world programming structures like class inheritance, modular architecture, and event-based logic ‚Äî all of which translate well to data analysis and machine learning workflows. 
  
  It also includes **built-in tools** for:
  - animations, 
  - sprite management, 
  - scene transitions, 
  - and hardware-accelerated rendering,   
  
  making it easier and faster to build polished 2D games without writing everything from scratch.

Like the previous Pygame-ce project, this one is also a practice project where I:
- put to use 
- enhance my **Python skills**
- and my **game development skills**,  
to develop a simple platformer game in Arcade version 3.
