    "## **Game Design Decisions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Game Type & Structure:**\n",
    "  The game is a text-based hack-and-slash where players engage in **turn-based** combat. The engine is intentionally minimal to start—essentially a **basic framework built with object-oriented principles**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterative Design Process:**\n",
    "  I plan to develop the game in **iterations**, starting with a very simple version (think “Version 0.001”) that will later evolve by **adding complexity**. This approach ensures that even if the full project seems overwhelming, it begins with a manageable, incremental process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Core Game Elements:**\n",
    "    - Player: The player character will have **key attributes** such as a name and a level. The level will directly **influence** their attack power, reinforcing the connection between progression and combat effectiveness.\n",
    "    - Enemy: The adversary is a generic monster, designed to be a **simple yet flexible opponent** that can be **expanded** upon in future iterations.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Game Flow & Options:**\n",
    "  At the **start**, players experience an introductory text (a nod to classic “Ready Player One” scenarios). When an enemy appears, players are given a set of options:\n",
    "  - **Attack**: Engage directly with the enemy.\n",
    "  - **Run**: Exit the encounter, which includes a brief delay to emphasize the action.\n",
    "  - **Pass**: Skip the turn, a choice that might still leave the player vulnerable to enemy attacks or even lead to facing a different foe.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inspiration & Vision:**\n",
    "  The design decisions draw heavily from classic video game experiences, ensuring that even this simplified game **reflects thoughtful gameplay mechanics and a clear, iterative developmental path**."
