This is a practice project aiming at the creation of a chatbot that can answer questions on movies using the following tech:  
- LLM: openAI 4o-mini
- vector embedding: 
  - cost: openAI "text-embedding-3-large" (openAI tiktoken module)
  - embedding: DuckDB
- RAG: langchain + Kaggle IMDb dataset

Here are the main steps of the project:  
- The dataset was first cleaned and then left with a 4 selected columns
- Langchain documents were prepped for vectorizing (langchain document)
- the cost of the embedding was calculated (tokenizer): only 4.9 cents (0.049$)
