This is part of the ML Pro bootcamp I started in September 2024. 

## **Tech stack**:
- streamlit
- OpenAI API & FastAPI (Swagger too)
- langchain v0.3 
- Python v3.12.8
- VsCode, Jupyter

The model used is the **3.5-turbo**. 

## **Project**:
Development of a simple AI-based summarizing app on Streamlit.  
The app: 
- works as a **chat interface**
- takes a local .txt file as an **input (upload)** 
- and **summarizes** it in an output
- with a **chat history** that was sumed up too

## **Benefits of this project**: 
- Prototyping apps on frameworks like Streamlit is essential to quickly and efficiently validate them as Proof of Concept. 
- APIs are today an integral part of most apps, so understanding them is a must. FastAPI facilitates their use within an app, saving time. 
- AI models like LLMs are increasingly adopted internally and so leveraging tools such as Langchain that facilitate their integration and use, together with APIs, saves time and cost.
